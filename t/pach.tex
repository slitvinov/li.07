The simulations reveal that the distribution of cell displacement is
non-uniform along the flow direction, i.e. RBCs do not flow in a
zigzag motion close to the middle Additionally, no stationary RBCs are
observed in the device.  Finally, the zigzag trajectories are observed
for any concentration/row of pillars.
